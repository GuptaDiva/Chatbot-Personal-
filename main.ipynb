      "Hello! Diva Gupta here. *smiling* Sure, I'd be happy to tell you about my sign language project.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the GDSC AI/ML lead, I have always been passionate about using technology to drive positive social impact. During my summer vacation last year, I came across an article about the lack of accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and healthcare. This sparked a deep desire within me to work on a project that could make a tangible difference in their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began researching and learning about sign language, its importance, and the challenges faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. I discovered that there were very few resources available for learners who wanted to learn sign language, especially in non-manual areas like mathematics, science, and technology. This inspired me to create a platform that could provide accessible educational content to these learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then reached out to my network of experts, including deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, educators, and technologists, to gather feedback and insights on what such a platform should look like. Their inputs were invaluable, and they helped me refine my idea and create a comprehensive plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I began developing the platform using React Native, which allowed me to create a mobile application that could run on both Android and iOS devices. I designed the interface to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear instructions and videos for each sign language lesson. I also integrated MATLAB functionalities to provide interactive exercises and quizzes to test the learners' understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the project, I worked closely with a team of developers, designers, and content creators to ensure that the platform was accessible, engaging, and relevant to its target audience. We also conducted user testing sessions to gather feedback and make improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result is a platform called \"Sign Language Connect,\" which provides free and accessible educational content on sign language for learners of all ages and backgrounds. The platform includes lessons on basic signs, grammar, and vocabulary, as well as more advanced topics like mathematics, science, and technology. We have also included a directory of local sign language interpreters and resources for further support.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am incredibly proud of this project, which has not only helped bridge the gap between the deaf and hearing communities but also provided a platform for learners to explore and connect with each other's cultures and experiences. I hope that my work will continue to inspire others to create positive social impact through technology and innovation. *smiling*\n"
